# Text Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project involves text prediction using a deep learning model, which is likely based on techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or any other appropriate architecture for sequence modeling. The goal is to build a model that can predict the next words in a given sequence of text.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TextPredictionProject.git
cd TextPredictionProject

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required Python packages by running:

### 3. Download Dataset
Prepare the dataset you want to use for training the model. You can use any text-based dataset, such as:

Gutenberg Dataset
Wikitext Dataset
Save your dataset in the data/ folder.

### 4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:
jupyter notebook deepLearning_text_predict_multi.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

### 5. Train the Model
In the notebook, you will find a section to:

Preprocess the text data (tokenization, sequence creation, etc.).
Define the deep learning model architecture (LSTM, GRU, or other).
Train the model using the prepared data.
### 6. Save the Trained Model
Once the training is complete, the trained model will be saved in the models/ directory. You can load this model later for further predictions or fine-tuning.

### 7. Make Predictions
After training, you can use the model to generate predictions on new text sequences.

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x: Programming language used for the project.
Keras/TensorFlow: Deep learning libraries for building and training the neural network.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization of results.
NLTK: (if applicable) For text preprocessing and tokenization.
## Model Overview
This project uses a sequence-to-sequence model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or its variants (LSTM/GRU) to predict the next word in a sequence. The architecture may include:

Embedding Layer: To convert words into dense vector representations.
Recurrent Layers (LSTM/GRU): To capture sequential dependencies.
Dense Layers: For output prediction.
## Results
After training, the model can be used to predict text sequences with reasonable accuracy depending on the quality and size of the training data. You can visualize training loss, accuracy, and other metrics using the plots generated in the notebook.
